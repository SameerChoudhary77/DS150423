# 1st Way
# lst = []

#     lst.append(lst_app)

# print(f'Your input is {lst}')

# for i in lst:
#     sumation += i

# average = sumation/iteraaation

# print(f'Sum of all the values is {sumation}')
# print(f'Average of all the values is {average}')





# 2nd Way
# size = int(input("enter the total no.of elements"))
# lst = []
# for i in range (size):
#     element = int(input(("please enter the element")))
#     lst.append(element)
# sum_of_list = sum(lst)
# avg_of_list = sum_of_list/size
